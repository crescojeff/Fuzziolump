The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&#39;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&#39;s intrusive. Also gross.

The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand in the laundry room.  A speck of lint drifts by, placidly.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. [[Evergreen foliage-&gt;Atrium_Glade_Foliage]], bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.

It could go with the whole crap from Earth lost in dryers theme, though it wouldn&#39;t explain immediately how Fuzziolump came to be in the first place.  Anyway, I was thinking nanites that are sensitive to specific electromagnetic fields generated by thought patterns of organisms, and take predictable actions based on the field modulations.  This would effectively allow for psychic/emotional magic by proxy, and could even explain how the creatures of FUzziolump came to be as they are (genetic manipulation to create sapience and foment nanite propogation and maximum evolution efficiency).
-Setting: SciFey meets Redwall Abbey.  Basically a world similar to the Pathfinder primordial Fey world, but with slightly less magic and more pseudo-science behind its inception via imagination/emotion.  Also, Redwall level cute creatures all over the place.  Specifically, I was thinking something along the lines of somehow &lt;insert pseudoscience here&gt; the world of Fuzziolump came into being as a parallel universe derived from the thoughts and feelings of earth lifeforms.  This process was glacial at first, but sped up greatly as sapience emerged.  Once sapient thought was being communicated by proxy via radio waves in various and sundry forms, the development process increased exponentially.  Basically Fuzziolump was fairly unevolved until humanity came around, and then was fairly primitive and amorphous until humans invented radio communications; the direct point to point electronic comm of telegraphy helped, but was less effective than blasting out thoughts to the ether for reception at some planned point, but then also anywhere else that happened to be receiving.
-Story: a group of Fuzziolumpkins have gone rogue and are trying to use human tech to destroy others?  Doesn&#39;t really jive with the nanite thing, or any magic system really.  I was thinking this when the world was supposed to be just animals with incidental human tech who eventually grew smarts because smarts were needed to survive in a world of randomly appearing and potentially deadly high technology.  I&#39;m thinking I want to go more Sanderson fantasy though; less pressure to explain everything in terms of real-ish science.

Okay, much more interesting story idea based on new SciFey setting -- the Fuzziolumpkins have been developing much more quickly since the onset of radio based tech in the 20th century, and now with broadband internet they&#39;re beginning to see a rather worrying trend: creatures something like gods are being born.  This apotheosis is frightening and occasionally disastrous, so they brought in a human creative to help them understand how to control and potentially dismantle some of the organisms resultant from human and now Fuzziolumpkin (which was inspired by human but now, relatively recently thanks to radio, exists independently) imagination.  At least one of these will be some sort of big bad that fights back, and others will be sympathetic spirits that are still problematic.

-Storyboard:
1. human goes through the dryer to the snowy glade and meets Mr. Tumn-- er Nuvi or whoever, the flying otter guide.  Otter explains somewhat about Fuzziolump and what the human should be doing there. EXPOSITION!

2. nuvi explains the problem they&#39;re having with pesky gods being born, and says that a consensus was reached by the animal council (insert animal themed council pun here) that a human creative should be brought in to help figure out how to slow and undo some of the creativity flying around.

3. first step on that journey is heading to the council so they can give more information on particularly troubling developments and decide which the human should address first.  The council resides in the Wombat Warren which is located north of the Frosted Forest in which the Atrium Glade resides.  The human must travel North through the Frosted Forest until the trees thin and the snows disappear, and the ecosystem suddenly changes to a warm savannah called the Bush.  There they will start to see holes everyplace, and Nuvi will inform the human that these all lead to the Wombat Warren.  However, some also travel to private dens, so the human must find public tunnels; this requires a wombat&#39;s sense.  Lacking same, the human must try and fail until patterns indicating private tunnels are noted in the individual tunnel descriptions.  The tunnel descriptions should show up randomly, and each failure tosses the human back to the edge of the Bush; this way they actually need to either get lucky or recognize the signs and pass over private burrows until they come randomly to one that does not fit the private bill, which will be a public tunnel.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Atrium_Glade_Wings_Compliment_Nuvi" tags="nuvi character_dev affinities" position="468,358" size="100,100">&quot;Why thank you, human!
