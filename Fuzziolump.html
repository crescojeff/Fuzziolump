The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&#39;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&#39;s intrusive. Also gross.

The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand in the laundry room.  A speck of lint drifts by, placidly.

As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They&#39;re the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.  
Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, shoulders, and bountiful cleavage of a miniature, winged woman staring at you with anxious eyes.  Before you can react, a hirsute arm snakes out and grabs you, pulling you into the dryer with monstrous strength.

Only, it&#39;s a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakeable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
A refreshing cool breeze carresses your cheek and ruffles the wintergreen foliage.  Only the gentle fwump fwump of the otter&#39;s wings breaks the tranquil silence, a comforting constant.

&quot;Specifically, you&#39;re standing in the Atrium Glade.  This is one of many portals to and from Earth that we call sockets.  Each socket has its own quirks, but generally conform to two main rules: they can operate two ways (Fuzziolump-&gt;Earth, Earth-&gt;Fuzziolump), and they can only be opened from Fuzziolump.  I like the Atrium Glade because everything looks like it should be in a bakery window!&quot;  The otter licks his fuzzy chops wistfully.

[[Exit Conversation-&gt;$current_room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="brainstorming" tags="design brainstorm dev" position="1,0" size="100,100">-Magic System: nanites?  It could go with the whole crap from Earth lost in dryers theme, though it wouldn&#39;t explain immediately how Fuzziolump came to be in the first place.  Anyway, I was thinking nanites that are sensitive to specific electromagnetic fields generated by thought patterns of organisms, and take predictable actions based on the field modulations.  This would effectively allow for psychic/emotional magic by proxy, and could even explain how the creatures of FUzziolump came to be as they are (genetic manipulation to create sapience and foment nanite propogation and maximum evolution efficiency).
-Setting: SciFey meets Redwall Abbey.  Basically a world similar to the Pathfinder primordial Fey world, but with slightly less magic and more pseudo-science behind its inception via imagination/emotion.  Also, Redwall level cute creatures all over the place.  Specifically, I was thinking something along the lines of somehow &lt;insert pseudoscience here&gt; the world of Fuzziolump came into being as a parallel universe derived from the thoughts and feelings of earth lifeforms.  This process was glacial at first, but sped up greatly as sapience emerged.  Once sapient thought was being communicated by proxy via radio waves in various and sundry forms, the development process increased exponentially.  Basically Fuzziolump was fairly unevolved until humanity came around, and then was fairly primitive and amorphous until humans invented radio communications; the direct point to point electronic comm of telegraphy helped, but was less effective than blasting out thoughts to the ether for reception at some planned point, but then also anywhere else that happened to be receiving.
-Story: a group of Fuzziolumpkins have gone rogue and are trying to use human tech to destroy others?  Doesn&#39;t really jive with the nanite thing, or any magic system really.  I was thinking this when the world was supposed to be just animals with incidental human tech who eventually grew smarts because smarts were needed to survive in a world of randomly appearing and potentially deadly high technology.  I&#39;m thinking I want to go more Sanderson fantasy though; less pressure to explain everything in terms of real-ish science.

Okay, much more interesting story idea based on new SciFey setting -- the Fuzziolumpkins have been developing much more quickly since the onset of radio based tech in the 20th century, and now with broadband internet they&#39;re beginning to see a rather worrying trend: creatures something like gods are being born.  This apotheosis is frightening and occasionally disastrous, so they brought in a human creative to help them understand how to control and potentially dismantle some of the organisms resultant from human and now Fuzziolumpkin (which was inspired by human but now, relatively recently thanks to radio, exists independently) imagination.  At least one of these will be some sort of big bad that fights back, and others will be sympathetic spirits that are still problematic.

-Rooms:
--Atrium Glade
--Badger Maze
--Spider Caverns
--Salamander Volcano
--Unicorn Plains
--Siren Grotto
--Nymph Willows: shade and privacy!
--Dryad Groves
--Primordial Booze: alcohol concentration where inhibitions are least and creative forces amongst the greatest.  Many small gods are popping up here, and obviously removing the booze is not an acceptable solution to control the situation.

-Objects:
--Treeminals
--Onyx eyes
--Staff of Creation: said to be a limb of the First Tree...

-Characters:
--Nuvi the flying otter guide: player&#39;s guide through their adventure.  Swims through the air via gravity assist of some sort; wings are slightly for precision maneuvers and mostly for show.

-Storyboard:
1. human goes through the dryer to the snowy glade and meets Mr. Tumn-- er Nuvi or whoever, the flying otter guide.  Otter explains somewhat about Fuzziolump and what the human should be doing there. EXPOSITION!
