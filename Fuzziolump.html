The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&#39;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&#39;s intrusive. Also gross.

The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand in the laundry room.  A speck of lint drifts by, placidly.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. [[Evergreen foliage-&gt;Atrium_Glade_Foliage]], bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.

It could go with the whole crap from Earth lost in dryers theme, though it wouldn&#39;t explain immediately how Fuzziolump came to be in the first place.  Anyway, I was thinking nanites that are sensitive to specific electromagnetic fields generated by thought patterns of organisms, and take predictable actions based on the field modulations.  This would effectively allow for psychic/emotional magic by proxy, and could even explain how the creatures of FUzziolump came to be as they are (genetic manipulation to create sapience and foment nanite propogation and maximum evolution efficiency).

--I&#39;m actually preferring something more fantasy-esque, such as subatomic organisms that react to thought/emotion EMFs in predictable ways.  That or maybe some particle or link between particles in Fuzziolump that reacts to psychic EMFs without any particular organism with motivations involved, such that the situation is effectively more direct rather than by proxy (really don&#39;t wanna proc memories of fucking midiclorians)

--the human&#39;s mana stat should be emotion levels, which will be modified by various actions.  Some will increase with related magic usage, but there will be negative consequences if they get too high (e.g. anger)!


-Setting: SciFey meets Redwall Abbey.  Basically a world similar to the Pathfinder primordial Fey world, but with slightly less magic and more pseudo-science behind its inception via imagination/emotion.  Also, Redwall level cute creatures all over the place.  Specifically, I was thinking something along the lines of somehow &lt;insert pseudoscience here&gt; the world of Fuzziolump came into being as a parallel universe derived from the thoughts and feelings of earth lifeforms.  This process was glacial at first, but sped up greatly as sapience emerged.  Once sapient thought was being communicated by proxy via radio waves in various and sundry forms, the development process increased exponentially.  Basically Fuzziolump was fairly unevolved until humanity came around, and then was fairly primitive and amorphous until humans invented radio communications; the direct point to point electronic comm of telegraphy helped, but was less effective than blasting out thoughts to the ether for reception at some planned point, but then also anywhere else that happened to be receiving.
-Story: a group of Fuzziolumpkins have gone rogue and are trying to use human tech to destroy others?  Doesn&#39;t really jive with the nanite thing, or any magic system really.  I was thinking this when the world was supposed to be just animals with incidental human tech who eventually grew smarts because smarts were needed to survive in a world of randomly appearing and potentially deadly high technology.  I&#39;m thinking I want to go more Sanderson fantasy though; less pressure to explain everything in terms of real-ish science.

Okay, much more interesting story idea based on new SciFey setting -- the Fuzziolumpkins have been developing much more quickly since the onset of radio based tech in the 20th century, and now with broadband internet they&#39;re beginning to see a rather worrying trend: creatures something like gods are being born.  This apotheosis is frightening and occasionally disastrous, so they brought in a human creative to help them understand how to control and potentially dismantle some of the organisms resultant from human and now Fuzziolumpkin (which was inspired by human but now, relatively recently thanks to radio, exists independently) imagination.  At least one of these will be some sort of big bad that fights back, and others will be sympathetic spirits that are still problematic.

-Combat:
Two easy options for combat in a text adventure
1. Choose your own adventure style, where each combat situation is really just another choice and only the details of the choice and associated consequences make it combat.
Pros:
-relatively easy to implement
Cons:
-combat doesn&#39;t feel much different from anything else
-in order for combat to be interesting, the author needs to ensure that the consequences of the offered choices could reasonably be deduced by the player ahead of time such that you don&#39;t run into those frustrating &#39;swing sword -&gt; obviously that means you catch your arm on a rock and the dragon eats you&#39; situations that leave the player feeling powerless and the game mechanics arbitrary.

2. RPG style turn-based combat with uniform set of actions and usual conditions for victory e.g. enemy or player runs out of HP.  In this case the choice set would be uniform and act as the combat interface.
Pros:
-player is more in control
-the system supports interesting combat and doesn&#39;t require as much setup and forethought by the author
Cons:
-relatively difficult to implement
-may leave combat less &#39;storied&#39; if sufficient wrapping narrative is not provided

--Sprig of Holly: focus for imagination due to its strong association with being a divine focus in lore.  Also, it has actually become a divine focus for the blossoming dryad goddess Holly for the same reason!  And yes, the name collision is confusing. 

-Characters:
--Nuvi the flying otter guide: player&#39;s guide through their adventure.  Swims through the air via gravity assist of some sort; wings are slightly for precision maneuvers and mostly for show.

-Storyboard:
1. human goes through the dryer to the snowy glade and meets Mr. Tumn-- er Nuvi or whoever, the flying otter guide.  Otter explains somewhat about Fuzziolump and what the human should be doing there. EXPOSITION!

2. nuvi explains the problem they&#39;re having with pesky gods being born, and says that a consensus was reached by the animal council (insert animal themed council pun here) that a human creative should be brought in to help figure out how to slow and undo some of the creativity flying around.

3. first step on that journey is heading to the council so they can give more information on particularly troubling developments and decide which the human should address first.  The council resides in the Wombat Warren which is located north of the Frosted Forest in which the Atrium Glade resides.  The human must travel North through the Frosted Forest until the trees thin and the snows disappear, and the ecosystem suddenly changes to a warm savannah called the Bush.  There they will start to see holes everyplace, and Nuvi will inform the human that these all lead to the Wombat Warren.  

/*
However, some also travel to private dens, so the human must find public tunnels; this requires a wombat&#39;s sense.  Lacking same, the human must try and fail until patterns indicating private tunnels are noted in the individual tunnel descriptions.  The tunnel descriptions should show up randomly, and each failure tosses the human back to the edge of the Bush; this way they actually need to either get lucky or recognize the signs and pass over private burrows until they come randomly to one that does not fit the private bill, which will be a public tunnel.
*/
What Wombats Want: However, most tunnels also pass by or even through private dens so the human must figure out what each wombat family they encounter wants in exchange for passage.  This will be hinted at in the descriptions of the dens, and some wombats may &quot;help&quot; with riddles. 

4. once inside the Wombat Warren, the human meets the animal council.  They inform human that Holly is the first god to approach, since she is growing like many, many weeds and is relatively amiable.  The main question is how the human should go about regressing or at least controlling the creativity that is driving her growth; the human has several choices for how to approach this [choice]{
a. violence (find vital module if possible, cut it out) [effect: nuvi aff -5, council aff +1]
b. hug it out (try to convince her that her wild growth is becoming deleterious to her fellow &#39;lumpkins) [effect: nvi aff +3, council aff: -1]
c. prune (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to limit her supply to the tune of reducing her expanse to a steady state -- halting her growth rather than reversing it) [effect: Nuvi aff +5, council aff: +3]
d. dig up the root (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to starve her of same until she wilts) [effect: Nuvi aff -10,  council aff: -5]

5. Having decided on a strategy, the human exits the Wombat Warren and heads towards the Blissful Blossoms forest to the West, where Holly makes her home.  On the way, the human is challenged by Puck, a pesky small god of the wind who listens to secrets and overheard the planning session with the council; he is in love with Holly, and will not hear of any suppression of her growth.  He fights the human!

You see, Fuzziolump has long been a place of peace for the most part, but recently there has been an upwelling of violence and turmoil.  The cause is our gods.  

We didn&#39;t have any at first.  The fully mortal lumpkins are quite complex enough, and even with the vast sum of Earth&#39;s imaginings it took ages for us to develop.  Several centuries have passed since we grew smart enough to start recording our history, and it seems the more we wrote and thought and felt the experiences of life, the faster Fuzziolump grew.  Its own denizens&#39; imaginings fuel it in addition to Earth&#39;s pool of creative energy, and this exponentiation has led to more potent lifeforms.  Effectively, gods.

Now, this might be cause for celebration -- a whole new category of sapient life, more deeply sapient than any of us can fathom!  Unfortunately, power and depth of mind do not equate to wisdom.  The young gods of Fuzziolump are all very different, but their common trait is an understandable lack of experience combined with an unprecedented ability to influence the world around them.  Some have even learned to syphon off the creative energy Fuzziolump thrives on, and threaten to collapse this world in on itself.  It isn&#39;t clear what would happen the gods if this world perished, but I and my loved ones and millions more like us would surely be snuffed out like the humble little candle flames we are.  I cannot allow that to happen.

What to do though?  Every lumpkin knows that Earth and humanity are our progenitors, specifically your creativity.  So, it only seemed reasonable to bring a human creative here to help untanlge this little knot of divinity.  You create every day -- [[you must know-&gt;Wombat_Warren_Reveal]] how to turn that power off, or keep it under control?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Wombat_Warren_Reveal" tags="quest main_quest" position="2,823" size="100,100">&quot;Is that not really a thing you humans do?  Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure something out!  Anyways, we need to present you to the Animal Council and discuss with them how to proceed.  We&#39;ll find them [[North-&gt;Bejeweled_Pines]] of the Frosted Forest (in which you stand currently), in the sandy savannah of the Wombat Warren.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Bejeweled_Pines" tags="room frosty_forest" position="2,973" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if visited() == 1&gt;&gt;
Nuvi flaps off northward a short span, then pauses as he notes you are not beside him.  Looking back and flashing a reassuring and whiskery grin, he proffers a fuzzy little paw to you.  Squaring your shoulders with purpose, you gently take the soft paw and allow the otter to lead you through the hidden paths in the thick snow-blanketed verge.  

After some stumbling and a small labyrinth of green and whit, he leads you to
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand amongst
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
a dazzling array of colors: the trees here are no less dusted with snow than their fellows you just pushed through, but they have also been festooned with crystal and glass baubles of every conceivable hue.  [[Little soft-glowing lights-&gt;Faery_Desc]] flit from ornament to ornament, keeping the emphasis and shading dynamic.

&quot;A small tree effigy fell into this forest long ago, decorated in a similar manner. The trees here were so smitten by the style they demanded to be honored with comparable shinies and lights.  The [[dryads-&gt;Dryad_Desc]] felt abashed that trees elsewhere were so honored, and strove to worship their charges fittingly.  Unluckily for the glass-blowers and enterprising faeries, the trend did not catch on elsewhere in the forest.&quot;

Nuvi flaps down close your ear, his whiskers tickling, and he whispers,  &quot;The other trees consider these ones a bit gaudy.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Faery_Desc" tags="creature lumpkin description" position="250,1101" size="100,100">Peering closely at the nearest bobbing lights, you note that at the center of each little sphere is a diminutive woman (you guess about 6cm in height) with six dragonfly wings. 

&quot;Those are faeries,&quot; Nuvi informs you, &quot;whimsical little beauties with insatiable curiosity.  They trade their light for secrets, whispered by the woods; little goes on anywhere nearby that isn&#39;t witnessed by the trees.&quot;

Each faery&#39;s wings are different colors, like intricate stained glass.  As you watch, a faery winks at you and performs a graceful series of barrel rolls while the colors of her wings shift and the soft lilac light pulsing off her skin twinkles to produce a mesmerizing chromatic metamorphosis.  She giggles at your awed expression, and [[zooms off out of sight-&gt;Faery_Friend]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Dryad_Desc" tags="description lumpkin creature" position="250,973" size="100,100">&quot;Dryads are the keepers of the woods.  They tend the trees, guide their growth, and defend them ferosciously.&quot;  Nuvi points a small claw toward a strange pattern along the bark of a nearby willow, and you realize a feminine face is looking back at you!  Wood creaks softly as she leans out from the tree to watch you passing.  Now that she has separated herself from the bark somewhat, you can see that a large assortment of the glitz you had taken for light cast by the tree&#39;s copious ornaments is actually jewelry.  A gleaming tiara adorns the mane of gossamer vines, leaves, and spider silk that form her waist-length hair.

&quot;They don&#39;t usually go in for all that finery, but the bejeweled dryads have as curious a sense of style as their trees.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Faery_Friend" tags="party_mod character shimmerin" position="250,1251" size="100,100">/*
This quest is entirely optional, and allows the player to add Shimmerin the faery to their party.  She will be useful in solving puzzles and in combat, but is not required.
*/
Nuvi hovers patiently nearby as you dart off after the faery.  She&#39;s waiting for you on the far side of the tree, and as soon as she confirms you are following her she winks cheerily and disappears into the surrounding foliage.  She seems to want you to [[chase her-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Begin]], but Nuvi is waiting [[back amongst the bejeweled pines-&gt;Bejeweled_Pines]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Shimmerin_Chase_Begin" tags="shimmerin party_mod character" position="240,1401" size="100,100">Crashing through the frosted pines as gracefully as possible for a fully grown human following a faery no larger than your little finger, you chase after the elusive sphere of lilac light.  Luckily, she&#39;s waiting just at the edge of the current clearing every time you make it through an obstacle blocking line of sight to her.  However, she has veered off in many different directions and you&#39;ve lost track of where you are relative to the Bejeweled Pines and Nuvi.

//todo: our first game element!  Surprise, surprise, it&#39;s a maze.  I don&#39;t want it to be a bunch of twisty passages all alike though; the player doesn&#39;t have enough inventory junk for that yet.  Plus those kinda suck.  There should be clear landmarks in the maze, allowing the player to actually learn and traverse it without making their own landmarks out of dropped items, BUT these landmarks should ideally shift as time goes by such that they really only exist as patterns of landscape.  That way the player has to recognize the patterns as a simple puzzle in order to navigate the maze. Shimmerin may alter things and leave false clues as well. 

// The simplest way to do something like the above would probably be to have a prefab maze in mind, and then randomly/conditionally change little bits of the descripter text for each room, and each room could be implemented as a prefab passage in Twine.  So draw that maze first!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="test_party_array" tags="test dev" position="412,1300.5" size="100,100">The starting party is: &lt;&lt;print $party&gt;&gt;, and after adding TestFriend
