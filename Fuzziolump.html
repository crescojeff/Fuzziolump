The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&#39;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&#39;s intrusive. Also gross.

[[Exit Conversation-&gt;Atrium Glade]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="brainstorming" tags="design brainstorm dev" position="1,0" size="100,100">-Magic System: nanites?  It could go with the whole crap from Earth lost in dryers theme, though it wouldn&#39;t explain immediately how Fuzziolump came to be in the first place.  Anyway, I was thinking nanites that are sensitive to specific electromagnetic fields generated by thought patterns of organisms, and take predictable actions based on the field modulations.  This would effectively allow for psychic/emotional magic by proxy, and could even explain how the creatures of FUzziolump came to be as they are (genetic manipulation to create sapience and foment nanite propogation and maximum evolution efficiency).

--I&#39;m actually preferring something more fantasy-esque, such as subatomic organisms that react to thought/emotion EMFs in predictable ways.  That or maybe some particle or link between particles in Fuzziolump that reacts to psychic EMFs without any particular organism with motivations involved, such that the situation is effectively more direct rather than by proxy (really don&#39;t wanna proc memories of fucking midiclorians).  

--Creatures encountered should be silly intelligent animals but also perhaps some more exotic things that could be symbolic of creativity and emotion, such as Madoka style abstract art lifeforms.  May also consider some dangerous and unfuzzy creatures to reflect the dark side of creativity and emotion.

--the human&#39;s mana stat should be emotion levels, which will be modified by various actions.  Some will increase with related magic usage, but there will be negative consequences if they get too high (e.g. anger)!


-Setting: SciFey meets Redwall Abbey.  Basically a world similar to the Pathfinder primordial Fey world, but with slightly less magic and more pseudo-science behind its inception via imagination/emotion.  Also, Redwall level cute creatures all over the place.  Specifically, I was thinking something along the lines of somehow &lt;insert pseudoscience here&gt; the world of Fuzziolump came into being as a parallel universe derived from the thoughts and feelings of earth lifeforms.  This process was glacial at first, but sped up greatly as sapience emerged.  Once sapient thought was being communicated by proxy via radio waves in various and sundry forms, the development process increased exponentially.  Basically Fuzziolump was fairly unevolved until humanity came around, and then was fairly primitive and amorphous until humans invented radio communications; the direct point to point electronic comm of telegraphy helped, but was less effective than blasting out thoughts to the ether for reception at some planned point, but then also anywhere else that happened to be receiving.
-Story: a group of Fuzziolumpkins have gone rogue and are trying to use human tech to destroy others?  Doesn&#39;t really jive with the nanite thing, or any magic system really.  I was thinking this when the world was supposed to be just animals with incidental human tech who eventually grew smarts because smarts were needed to survive in a world of randomly appearing and potentially deadly high technology.  I&#39;m thinking I want to go more Sanderson fantasy though; less pressure to explain everything in terms of real-ish science.

Okay, much more interesting story idea based on new SciFey setting -- the Fuzziolumpkins have been developing much more quickly since the onset of radio based tech in the 20th century, and now with broadband internet they&#39;re beginning to see a rather worrying trend: creatures something like gods are being born.  This apotheosis is frightening and occasionally disastrous, so they brought in a human creative to help them understand how to control and potentially dismantle some of the organisms resultant from human and now Fuzziolumpkin (which was inspired by human but now, relatively recently thanks to radio, exists independently) imagination.  At least one of these will be some sort of big bad that fights back, and others will be sympathetic spirits that are still problematic.

-Combat:
Two easy options for combat in a text adventure
1. Choose your own adventure style, where each combat situation is really just another choice and only the details of the choice and associated consequences make it combat.
Pros:
-relatively easy to implement
Cons:
-combat doesn&#39;t feel much different from anything else
-in order for combat to be interesting, the author needs to ensure that the consequences of the offered choices could reasonably be deduced by the player ahead of time such that you don&#39;t run into those frustrating &#39;swing sword -&gt; obviously that means you catch your arm on a rock and the dragon eats you&#39; situations that leave the player feeling powerless and the game mechanics arbitrary.

2. RPG style turn-based combat with uniform set of actions and usual conditions for victory e.g. enemy or player runs out of HP.  In this case the choice set would be uniform and act as the combat interface.
Pros:
-player is more in control
-the system supports interesting combat and doesn&#39;t require as much setup and forethought by the author
Cons:
-relatively difficult to implement
-may leave combat less &#39;storied&#39; if sufficient wrapping narrative is not provided

-Objects:
--Treeminals
--Onyx eyes
--Staff of Creation: said to be a limb of the First Tree...
--Sprig of Holly: focus for imagination due to its strong association with being a divine focus in lore.  Also, it has actually become a divine focus for the blossoming dryad goddess Holly for the same reason!  And yes, the name collision is confusing. 

-Characters:
--Nuvi the flying otter guide: player&#39;s guide through their adventure.  Swims through the air via gravity assist of some sort; wings are slightly for precision maneuvers and mostly for show.  He is very dapper and proper, and he worries about the human&#39;s safety.  His opinion re: the godlings is that they&#39;re rampant growth has to be checked for the good of all, but that new lifeforms should be allowed to thrive.
--Shimmerin the faerie princess: she is a trickster among tricksters and wishes to revive the faerie courts so that faeries can act freely in Fuzziolump as they once did.  To do this, she will need the power of the First Summer Queen&#39;s tiara.  The treasure hoard of the faeries is cursed to only allow those with hearts as pure as a mole&#39;s to touch it, and hers is darkened by bitterness.  She tempts the human to follow her in hopes that they can either touch the treasure themselves or manipulate an ice mole into doing it for them.  Since she wants to see the current Fuzziolump regime fall, she is secretly in favor of the godling revolution and will subtley hinder the human on their quest to stop it.  Despite her somewhat dark agenda, she is friendly by default and enjoys joking with comrades.  The human fascinates her, and she is constantly tryint to learn more about humanity.  She is good at heart and can be redeemed once her secret is out, so long as the human is amenable to revisiting the status of faeries in Fuzziolump with the council.  Else, she will fight the human when the truth comes out. She has a limited ability to grant wishes, in exchange for dreams; if the player allows her to eat some number of their dreams, Shimmerin can work wonders like curative magic which is otherwise very rare.  She presents this exchange as giving her creative inspiration, which it does, which she can use to power the godlings, but it also gives her footholds into the player&#39;s psyche.  The more she has, the more difficult she will be to resist when the truth comes out.
--Woolliam the tenacious wombat: gentle, kind, and determined, Woolliam insists on accompanying the human to help in quelling the growing godling threat, despite the wombat elder&#39;s refusal.  He wants to protect those in his humble sphere of influence and believes he cannot do so without venturing outside the warren.  He will follow the player as stealthily as a wombat can (not very) and provide random assistance.  Despite his brave attempts to help, he is actually pathologically shy and has great difficulty dealing with anyone.  Shimmerin delights in tormenting him. 
--Puck the spirit of ivy: clingy spirit obsessed with Holly; she does not comprehend his feelings, and is amused by his attentions.  She encourages/teases him without understanding the cruelty of these actions.  He wants to see her continue to ascend no matter what the cost, and will fight to the death if he feels she is being threatened.
--Holly the wild goddess (godling): godling of nature and wild things who has gained much perspective from being in many places at once, and has also lost a fair bit from the vantage of lesser beings (e.g. empathy with Puck).  She adores all living things and wants to be sweet and gentle with them; her unpredictable temper makes this difficult, however, and her connection to so many imaginations is making her grow faster than any godling.  Even if she realized the danger she poses to those living things around her by her growth she likely could not stop herself without help. 

-Storyboard:
1. human goes through the dryer to the snowy glade and meets Mr. Tumn-- er Nuvi or whoever, the flying otter guide.  Otter explains somewhat about Fuzziolump and what the human should be doing there. EXPOSITION!

2. nuvi explains the problem they&#39;re having with pesky gods being born, and says that a consensus was reached by the animal council (insert animal themed council pun here) that a human creative should be brought in to help figure out how to slow and undo some of the creativity flying around.

2.1 a faerie is encountered in the bejeweled pines room of the frosted forest, and the player can optionally chase after her to get her in the party as a side quest.

3. first step on that journey is heading to the council so they can give more information on particularly troubling developments and decide which the human should address first.  The council resides in the Wombat Warren which is located north of the Frosted Forest in which the Atrium Glade resides.  The human must travel North through the Frosted Forest until the trees thin and the snows disappear, and the ecosystem suddenly changes to a warm savannah called the Bush.  There they will start to see holes everyplace, and Nuvi will inform the human that these all lead to the Wombat Warren.  

/*
However, some also travel to private dens, so the human must find public tunnels; this requires a wombat&#39;s sense.  Lacking same, the human must try and fail until patterns indicating private tunnels are noted in the individual tunnel descriptions.  The tunnel descriptions should show up randomly, and each failure tosses the human back to the edge of the Bush; this way they actually need to either get lucky or recognize the signs and pass over private burrows until they come randomly to one that does not fit the private bill, which will be a public tunnel.
*/
What Wombats Want: However, most tunnels also pass by or even through private dens so the human must figure out what each wombat family they encounter wants in exchange for passage.  This will be hinted at in the descriptions of the dens, and some wombats may &quot;help&quot; with riddles. 

4. once inside the Wombat Warren, the human meets the animal council.  They inform human that Holly is the first god to approach, since she is growing like many, many weeds and is relatively amiable.  The main question is how the human should go about regressing or at least controlling the creativity that is driving her growth; the human has several choices for how to approach this [choice]{
a. violence (find vital module if possible, cut it out) [effect: nuvi aff -5, council aff +1]
b. hug it out (try to convince her that her wild growth is becoming deleterious to her fellow &#39;lumpkins) [effect: nvi aff +3, council aff: -1]
c. prune (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to limit her supply to the tune of reducing her expanse to a steady state -- halting her growth rather than reversing it) [effect: Nuvi aff +5, council aff: +3]
d. dig up the root (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to starve her of same until she wilts) [effect: Nuvi aff -10,  council aff: -5]

5. Having decided on a strategy, the human exits the Wombat Warren and heads towards the Blissful Blossoms forest to the West, where Holly makes her home.  On the way, the human is challenged by Puck, a pesky small god of the wind who listens to secrets and overheard the planning session with the council; he is in love with Holly, and will not hear of any suppression of her growth.  He fights the human!

// todox: why is the human needed?  while we&#39;re expositioning, we might as well make it clear how/why the lumpkins expect a human to be able to solve these problems better than them.  Maybe all lumpkins are Sorcerers (born with limited set of inherent magic talents) and humans in Fuzziolump are Wizards due to progenitor position leverage (can learn any magic)?  And there was once one lumpkin with a talent that could potentially slay these godlings (like unmaking imagination sort of thing, voidmancer) and he kept a grimoire that a Wizard could actually learn from.

// todox: The Choice: the human gets to choose an approach for taking on Holly that will shape the story&#39;s progression from this point and massively impact how the council and Nuvi think of the human.
1. Total war: kill every last vestige of Holly &#39;til nothing is left, using Adrammalocke&#39;s grimoire
2. Surgical Strike: terminate the feedback loop, and maybe hope it returns the Holly to her old lumpkin-y self instead of killing her horribly
3.

You see, Fuzziolump has long been a place of peace for the most part, but recently there has been an upwelling of violence and turmoil.  The cause is our gods.  

We didn&#39;t have any at first.  The fully mortal lumpkins are quite complex enough, and even with the vast sum of Earth&#39;s imaginings it took ages for us to develop.  Several centuries have passed since we grew smart enough to start recording our history, and it seems the more we wrote and thought and felt the experiences of life, the faster Fuzziolump grew.  Its own denizens&#39; imaginings fuel it in addition to Earth&#39;s pool of creative energy, and this exponentiation has led to more potent lifeforms.  Effectively, gods.

Now, this might be cause for celebration -- a whole new category of sapient life, more deeply sapient than any of us can fathom!  Unfortunately, power and depth of mind do not equate to wisdom.  The young gods of Fuzziolump are all very different, but their common trait is an understandable lack of experience combined with an unprecedented ability to influence the world around them.  Some have even learned to syphon off the creative energy Fuzziolump thrives on, and threaten to collapse this world in on itself.  It isn&#39;t clear what would happen the gods if this world perished, but I and my loved ones and millions more like us would surely be snuffed out like the humble little candle flames we are.  I cannot allow that to happen.

Nuvi flaps off northward a short span, then pauses as he notes you are not beside him.  Looking back and flashing a reassuring and whiskery grin, he proffers a fuzzy little paw to you.  Squaring your shoulders with purpose, you gently take the soft paw and allow the otter to lead you through the hidden paths in the thick snow-blanketed verge.  

After some stumbling and a small labyrinth of green and whit, he leads you to
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand amongst
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
a dazzling array of colors: the trees here are no less dusted with snow than their fellows you just pushed through, but they have also been festooned with crystal and glass baubles of every conceivable hue.  [[Little soft-glowing lights-&gt;Faery_Desc]] flit from ornament to ornament, keeping the emphasis and shading dynamic.

&quot;A small tree effigy fell into this forest long ago, decorated in a similar manner. The trees here were so smitten by the style they demanded to be honored with comparable shinies and lights.  The [[dryads-&gt;Dryad_Desc]] felt abashed that trees elsewhere were so honored, and strove to worship their charges fittingly.  Unluckily for the glass-blowers and enterprising faeries, the trend did not catch on elsewhere in the forest.&quot;

Nuvi flaps down close your ear, his whiskers tickling, and he whispers,  &quot;The other trees consider these ones a bit gaudy.&quot;  He holds a little paw over his mouth to stifle his giggles.  When his hearty laughter knocks his monocle off, he sobers quickly.  Alighting by your foot to retrieve it, he clears his throat and asks, &quot;Shall we [[continue North to the plains?-&gt;Bush]]&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Faery_Desc" tags="creature lumpkin description" position="170,1045" size="100,100">Peering closely at the nearest bobbing lights, you note that at the center of each little sphere is a diminutive woman (you guess about 6cm in height) with six dragonfly wings. 

&quot;Those are faeries,&quot; Nuvi informs you, &quot;whimsical little beauties with insatiable curiosity.  They trade their light for secrets, whispered by the woods; little goes on anywhere nearby that isn&#39;t witnessed by the trees.&quot;

Each faery&#39;s wings are different colors, like intricate stained glass.  As you watch, a faery winks at you and performs a graceful series of barrel rolls while the colors of her wings shift and the soft lilac light pulsing off her skin twinkles to produce a mesmerizing chromatic metamorphosis.

Wood creaks softly as she leans out from the tree to watch you passing.  Now that she has separated herself from the bark somewhat, you can see that a large assortment of the glitz you had taken for light cast by the tree&#39;s copious ornaments is actually jewelry.  A gleaming tiara adorns the mane of gossamer vines, leaves, and spider silk that form her waist-length hair.

Nuvi hovers patiently nearby as you dart off after the faery.  She&#39;s waiting for you on the far side of the tree, and as soon as she confirms you are following her she winks cheerily and disappears into the surrounding foliage.

You stand in the center of what was once a grand antechamber, for certain values of grand: everything, from the fallen grandiose pillars to the rime-encrusted iron skeletons of elaborate furniture is miniature scale relative to you.  It feels a bit like walking into a dollhouse store that a ruination of weather and time have trampled to ghostly memories. 

The faery giggles and flits off through a [[close copse of pines to the East-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Frozen_Stair]], leaving a sprinkle of powder in her wake. There is an [[old and sturdy rope-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Diamond_Throneroom]] hanging over a small cliff to the South.  Away West, a collapsed archway leads to a subtley sunken glade that may once have been a [[gallery of sorts-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Treasure_Of_Stillness]].

	You can hear a faint whisper on the wind, &quot;Human!  Huuuuuuuman!&quot;.  It sounds vaguely dapper and certainly whiskery, so you deduce it is likely Nuvi looking for you.  You could choose to [[follow the voice if you&#39;re done playing with the faery.-&gt;Bejeweled_Pines]]

//todox: our first game element!  Surprise, surprise, it&#39;s a maze.  I don&#39;t want it to be a bunch of twisty passages all alike though; the player doesn&#39;t have enough inventory junk for that yet.  Plus those kinda suck.  There should be clear landmarks in the maze, allowing the player to actually learn and traverse it without making their own landmarks out of dropped items, BUT these landmarks should ideally shift as time goes by such that they really only exist as patterns of landscape.  That way the player has to recognize the patterns as a simple puzzle in order to navigate the maze. Shimmerin may alter things and leave false clues as well. 

// The simplest way to do something like the above would probably be to have a prefab maze in mind, and then randomly/conditionally change little bits of the descripter text for each room, and each room could be implemented as a prefab passage in Twine.  So draw that maze first!

//todo: make the mole go CC when player is already in the room when it arrives.  Also make sure the mole&#39;s direction of burrowing is clear so that this doesn&#39;t turn into another Rilix Castle situation that can&#39;t be solved without already knowing the map.

You stand in a small valley surrounded by sheer cliffs of slick sapphire ice and unforgiving slate-gray stone.  The remains of graduated curved stone benches step down in a hemisphere around a clearing below and infrastructure that reminds you of the retractable roofing in fancier outdoor theatres peeks out from snow drifts here and there.  Down at the center of the declining rows of benches is a large marble dais, upon which proudly stands the most enormously overwrought chair you&#39;ve ever seen -- truly a throne.  It is majestic and imperious, with impossibly intricate and delicate gossamer weaves of crystals and gems decorating its broad frame; the morning light shining through their many hues blankets the dais in a constant rainbow corona.  The dais abutts a massive waterfall, all its roaring might condensed into a single moment frozen forever in time.  And ice.  A chill wind kisses your cheek and you shiver, feeling profoundly alone.

Heaps of gold coins and gemstones lay scattered about in the snow and ice.

You stand in a large clearing where someone has apparently cultivated a vast garden of crystals.  Instead of the soft greens of pine and holly, eldritch purples, blues, reds, and every color imaginable (and a few that are like no color you&#39;ve imagined previously) filter the subtle sunlight into spectacular rainbows over you.  The dusting of snow only mutes the effect slightly, pleasantly keeping it mysterious rather than gaudy.  Faeries flit amongst the crystalline horticulture, adding their own colors to the filtered sunlight.  Brushing by an explosion of amethyst that looks a bit lke the leaves of a pineapple, you shy away as a sharp pain stings your arm and a warm rivulet of blood seeps into your clothing -- the verge here is beautiful and deadly. 

Several of the crystals are carved to look like fanciful animals (or, here, regular animals) reading books and wearing stylish clothes.  There are humans too, as well as a few winged humanoids that might be faeries; you note that they are the same size.  The time and care involved in cultivating and pruning crystal topiary boggles your mind. 
As a cool wind ruffles the distant foliage, the crystal garden produces a light tinkling that settles into a deeper resonant hum as the garden vibrates. 

&lt;&lt;if not $party.includes($character_shimmerin)&gt;&gt;
The fairy you&#39;re chasing peeks out from behind a sapphire flower as tall as you.  When she sees you approaching, she winks flirtatiously and blows you a little kiss.

		Then, her eyes shift to your pack, which has begun to hum and vibrate softly.  Zooming over in a blur of enthusiasm, the little fairy opens your pack, dives in, and emerges holding reverently the tiny tiara you picked up in the treasure room.
		
		&quot;This... how did you get this?&quot; she asks, breathlessly, her face a mask of astonishment and all pretense of teasing silliness forgotten.  &quot;She&#39;s the Summer Queen&#39;s own tiara, and has been lost to us since the fall of the courts centuries ago.  Everything hears her call, faeries most of all, so we knew she was under the ice amongst the forsaken treasures but no one could get past the treasure&#39;s curse to reach her!&quot;
		// todo: the question should be more how rather than where, since the treasure room is right over there.  I would say the focus should be on the treasure&#39;s curse repelling raiders, and the mole&#39;s pure goodness and innocence making it immune.  As for why the fairy never noticed that, well maybe the mole isn&#39;t frightened of them and/or maybe they don&#39;t have the attention to detail necessary to set up the mole to dig things out for them.
		
		// todo: do we want a conversation here?  It could be done without too too much hassle by setting control vars to manage the passage text here and adding an exit conversation link in the conversation branch passages that comes back here.  Does it serve a purpose, however?  On the one hand, we could force the player&#39;s tongue here and give their truthful answer about the mole which would allow Shimmerin to respond that she never noticed the mole digging frenziedly and/or was unable/unwilling to frighten it.  On the other hand, we could let the player lie or ignore Shimmerin, which would mod her affinity.  We could even give the player a CHA score, which can be influenced by equipment etc, which influences the likelihood of the bluff succeeding.  I guess the main question is: is there a response the player could give that would significantly (i.e. not just slight affinity mod) change something re: Shimmerin in the story going forward?  Eh, I suppose so: maybe Shimmerin decides that the player must be as good-hearted and earnest as a mole and the aff takes a big jump up AND we add &#39;mole-level-good&#39; to her inductive bias re: the player, which could well have important consequences later (e.g. she assumes something that can&#39;t hurt the pure of heart can&#39;t hurt the player, and so doesn&#39;t warn them...)

You shrug and explain the situation as best you can, &quot;An ice mole was digging amongst the treasure, and I think I startled it -- it burrowed away in a hurry, scattering ice and buried treasures.  The tiara was one of the treasures revealed around the mole hole.&quot; 

Shimmerin&#39;s eyes brighten and a broad grin lights up her face.  &quot;You were able to get the mole to dig treasure out of the ice?  But he&#39;s so stubborn!  He&#39;s usually too focused on his snow shoveling to do anything else, even when offered treats.  I&#39;m too small for him to take much notice anyway, so I haven&#39;t been able to effectively enlist his services.&quot;  She places the tiara on her head, carefully arranging her auburn locks so that they optimally frame the gorgeous treasure.

Though snow falls visibly, almost mockingly, not 100 yards to the South, the temperature in the savannah feels closer to boiling.

&quot;Ecosystems work pretty differently here,&quot; Nuvi explains, prompted by your stunned expression.  &quot;They depend more on our collective conception of what a place should be like rather than weather patterns and physics and all that fluff humans are always going on about.&quot;  Despite the heat, your thick-furred companion glides along as serenely as ever.  He hums [[a tune you&#39;re unfamiliar with-&gt;Bush_Tune]].

&quot;We&#39;re coming up on the wombats,&quot; Nuvi intones conspiratorially.  &quot;Now the thing to know about wombats is that they&#39;re diggers through and through.&quot;  He watches you, clearly expecting a nod of understanding or similar sign to indicate that this means something to you.  When none is forthcoming, he elaborates, &quot;Digging creatures have gotta be determined and patient, tough but fair and above all smart and calm, or they won&#39;t make it through their first cave-in.  Keep that in mind when talking with them.&quot;

Innumerable holes dot the landscape like spots on a giraffe, which, incidentally, you can see several of in the distance.

To the West, the Savannah opens up into a vast sea of grasses and roaming wildlife.  A distant craggy mountain range looms in the East.  Several curious whiskered faces are poking up out of the nearest [[hole directly North-&gt;Bush_Wombat_Burrow_1]].

todo: the puzzle here is to find the item or perform the service of one of the wombat families to gain passage through their burrow to the warren proper.  The moon logic here is that wombats trust deeply but require that trust to be earned, so the tribute stuff should be more practical than flattering.  Now the tricky part here is that it doesn&#39;t make any damn sense for the wombats to be cryptic about what they need, but at the same time nobody likes a fetch quest.  Probably a fair compromise is to have the wombats simply present a problem they need help with and finding a solution in the world is up to the player.  However, that sounds like a job for after demo, when the world is more expansive.  Maybe for now simply have each present a situation that requires the player to spend resources?

Wombat Family 1: needs help treating their sick elders.  (can be helped either by med. herb from Frosty Forest, or from Shimmerin healing wish)

Wombat Family 2: needs help rescuing a trapped digger from a collapsed tunnel. (can be helped by player physically at the cost of health, or small amount of mana can be expended for a risky teleportation rescue that can fail).

Wombat Family 3: needs to cross a chasm to explore new tunneling territory. (faerie statue can be used for limited flight, or player can spend mana to do same)

Alternatively/additionally, I&#39;d like some kind of wombat digging dungeon angle, maybe a maze or similar challenge to make the human prove they have a wombat&#39;s good sense and sensibilities by way of being at home underground.  A simple and expediant possibility might be for Sheila to simply give the player a series of what-ifs to answer, centered around wombatian ethics and concerns.  The player&#39;s answers will contribute to Sheila&#39;s inductive bias re: player, and will also have a point value that needs to reach some threshold for the human to be named Wombuddy.  The tricky part with this option is failure: if the human doesn&#39;t meet the threshold, what happens?  New what-if scenarios and associated chances to answer are the most obvious recourse other than simple GAME OVER, which is stupid, but that would require generative narrative.  Maybe we could get away with a single set of scenarios, but have Sheila remember and comment if the player needs to basically exhaust all their options.  Since the player&#39;s choices will be canned responses from them, it wouldn&#39;t look to Sheila like the player had simply tried every choice combo, but at the same time she would know that the player had to make multiple attempts at coming up with satisfactory answers.  This could go into the persistent inductive bias of both Sheila and Nuvi, and effect events later in the game.

&lt;&lt;if visited() == 1&gt;&gt;
&quot;A human!&quot; a small voice squeaks, and the whiskered faces disappear down the hole.  You approach slowly, Nuvi in the lead -- being a more familiar sight to them, he can serve as a sort of literally soft transition for the little wombats. 

&quot;Hello gentle wombats!&quot;  Nuvi calls out ahead.  &quot;I&#39;m an agent of the council, escorting a human consultant to help with our little problem.  We&#39;ll need to pass through into the Warren, please and thank you.&quot;

A broad snout covered in a wiry blanket of tawny fur rises above the lip of the hole, a steady brow arched skeptically over glistening black eyes.  A breath of lilacs whispers past as the wombat emerges, so subtle you&#39;re not certain you trust your sniffer. &quot;Human?  To see the council?  The situation must be getting desperate, indeed.&quot;  The wombat levels a stern but fair gaze at you. &quot;Their presence here will accelerate the godlings&#39; growth -- the council realizes that don&#39;t they?&quot;

Nuvi performs a placating barrel roll and responds, &quot;Peace, noble wombat sister.  The council is well aware of the many consequences associated with bringing a human to Fuzziolump, chief among them the imaginative accelerant effect.  It was decided that the risk of accelerating the godlings&#39; expansion was worth taking if it might mean stopping them altogether.  This human is a creative, an expert on generating and, presumably, suppressing creativity.&quot;

The wombat taps her tough leathery nose several times with a mighty digging claw as she considers the otter&#39;s words.  &quot;So they&#39;ve run out of ideas that aren&#39;t dangerous and foolhardy, then?  Fine enough.  However, the warren is a place of wombats and wombuddies, and the only way in leads through our home burrows.  This human will need to prove themselves a wombuddy just like anyone else before they can pass through.&quot;

You&#39;re forced to travel at a hunch due to the usual denizens&#39; small stature, but the curious fuzzy faces peering out at you from myriad offshoot tunnels more than make up for the discomfort.  That said, you could do without bopping your head repeatedly on the irregularly shaped luminous fungi that grow along the tunnel ceiling providing light to traveling tunnelers.  

Now you can see why Sheila was so adamant about your wombatitude -- people&#39;s dens are built off of the main tunnel passage with no obvious doors or other separators.  Wombats are evidently a very integrated people and not very shy about their personal space.  That seems prudent for a tunneling culture.

After a few hundred meters of home tunnels, storage tunnels, and windy tunnels whose purpose you cannot fathom, the main tunnel opens up into a vast hub chamber where you can finally stand up.

&quot;The day has been perfect: timbers were erected effeciently as support struts, and every measurement and calculation was correct on the first go.  The soil was all soft and loamy, such that tunneling was more like being a joey again playing in the mud than work.  Your people are all safe and happy and contentedly tired from a day&#39;s honest labor.  As everyone is leaving the tunnel, it all comes crashing down -- literally.  
Termites, those evil buggers, have weakened a timber toward front of the tunnel and it collapses just before the last of your people make it out!  Two are trapped inside: a grey-furred elder just about ready for retirement and a youngster who regularly exhausts himself to prove his competence.  The greyback was close to the exit when the tunnel collapsed, only two or three body lengths deep.  The ambitious youngling is much further back, but also possibly behind the actual collapse instead of beneath it.  You&#39;re the forebeast, and responsible for their lives.

The tunnel beneath the gaudy crest quickly metamorphoses from lovingly sculpted earth to carefully hewn stone.  The tough gray rock has been chiseled to almost frictionless smoothness somehow, and only the colder temperature and reduced springiness of the subtrate alerted your feet to any change from the earthen tunnels.

Golden sunlight floods the council chamber from an aperture some three dozen meters above you.  A complex series of pulleys rises along the stone wall on the far side of a massive round table, with thick cord threaded through each.  You wonder briefly what function such a convoluted mechanical system serves.  The walls and floor are completely bare of ornamentation; this room was clearly intended for serious matters.

Thirteen robed bipedal animals shuffle out of a nondescript wooden door you hadn&#39;t even noticed beside the gleamingly polished oak table adorning the center of the dais.  Twelve take seats around the table, and one approaches you and Nuvi.  Nuvi flaps apprehensively as the young vixen approaches, her sleek scarlet fur impeccably groomed despite the tale of many sleepless nights told by her sunken and bloodshot eyes.  Her gold eyes study you intently, no less keen for her apparent fatigue.  Without a word she nods as if reaching some tacit conclusion, and the motions to someone behind you.  

Turning slightly, though taking care not to turn your back on the council member, you watch warily as two large badgers roll an enormous stone into the mouth of the tunnel, sealing it behind you.  No going back now.  These same fellows then jog over the pulley mechanism: as they take turns heaving on the cord, a stone slides into place over the sunny inlet aperture far above, and the chamber is &lt;&lt;link &quot;plunged into darkness.&quot;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;&lt;replace &quot;#council_chamber_desc&quot;&gt;&gt;
Glimmering lights in a thousand rainbow hues spring to life from the darkness, casting variably inviting and intimidating aesthetics upon the stark room.  They are faeries, but they seem notably more subdued than those you saw back in the Frosty Forest.  One drifts lazily toward you, alighting upon your shoulder.  Her glittering emerald gemstone eyes are dull and seem unfocused.  She smiles vaguely at you and then flits off dreamily in no particular direction.
&lt;&lt;if $party.includes($characters[&quot;shimmerin&quot;])&gt;&gt;
Shimmerin buzzes angrily from your pocket, refusing to look at the other faerie.
// todo: Shimmerin should be outraged by the &#39;tame&#39; faeries, and should really cause a ruckus here
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
// todo: EXPOSITION!!! *sigh* need a more show don&#39;t tell approach, like Marrah having the faeries act out the scene of lumpkin inception from creative energy.
The fox approaches you and proffers her paw.  You extend a hand, unsure what she expects, and she rests her paw on it in an apparent show of solidarity.  &quot;Warm regards, human.  My name is Marrah, Voice of the council of animals.  I have never met one of your kind, one of the progenitors, but sadly there is no time to get to know one another.  Behold!&quot;

She flings her paw commandingly toward the center of the table without taking her shining gaze off you.  The faerie lights floating about the room zoom together into a formless mass above the table for a moment, and then resolve into a glowing map of Fuzziolump.  Three continents are outlined in soft azure light, west, central, and east.  &quot;Show us Holly&#39;s reach,&quot; Marrah barks, and a circle of almost poisonously bright green spreads out from the center of the central continent to cover roughly 50% of it. 

&quot;We are here,&quot; she points to a spot just to the west of the green zone&#39;s reach.  &quot;Just out of her grasp, for now.  Before we discuss the threat posed by the godlings, however, I should explain in more detail what exactly these creatures are.  All lumpkins and in fact the world of Fuzziolump itself are born of imagination and emotion, with creative energies being especially fertile.  At first this energy came almost exclusively from humans and some of the craftier monkeys of your earth. 

// todo: something about creativity having a life of its own and passing that life onto created works... or radiating it off into places like Fuzziolump.

&quot;Fuzziolump has existed for almost as long as human life on earth, our first life emerging from your ancestors&#39; early experiments with cavernous canvas.  Intelligent life here is fairly new, however -- it takes quite a lot of imagination to wire up a complex brain, and the dribs and drabs of imaginative energy siphoned off of earth&#39;s creative corona probably never would have done it.  About a century ago, however, something changed fundamentally: your Guglielmo Marconi developed the first long distance radio!  As you know, broadcast technology exploded throughout your 20th century. These transmission served as much more efficient conduits of the thoughts and feelings on earth, and the pace and sophistication of lumpkin development increased exponentially. 

&quot;Once life here developed sufficient intelligence to start dreaming on its own, we became fully self-sustaining and self-propagating.  Therein lay the problem.  Our development had been fairly measured, if mildly explosive, up until a year ago.  One year ago today, two lumpkins embarked on an experiment that will either &lt;&lt;link &quot;open a new horizon of existence for us, or kill us all.&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;replace &quot;#council_chamber_desc&quot;&gt;&gt;
&quot;Dr. Beakman, please tell us what you&#39;ve learned about the Reckless.&quot; 

A toucan with a massive rainbow beak stands up, and Marrah takes her seat. &quot;Drs. Hashmalum and Holly were among our brightest, back when they still had hold of their sanity.  They were interested in a phenomenon of creativity wherein two lumpkins engaged in a cooperative act of creation can actually form a positive feedback loop that would empower both.  In naturally occurring small doses, this phenomenon simply means that both parties create a little more of whatever they&#39;re working on together than they could have done apart because the loop will normally collapse quickly.  The collapse comes when focus wavers or fatigue sets in, both terminal conditions that are sure to arise swiftly for any lumpkin or similar organism.

&quot;Hashmalum and Holly&#39;s dangerous idea was to bring a third party into the mix, one that was not subject to the same limitations of organic life.  We&#39;ve been monitoring human progress on artificial intelligence and machine learning carefully over the years, since it reminds us of ourselves and our origins.  Holly, the greater artist of the two, designed a program that used recursive transition networks and massive text corpi to generate narrative automatically.  Unlike other such programs, it was particularly capable at adapting novel corpi to its output at runtime.  

&quot;Hashmalum rigged up some impressive hardware to run the program, and also an apparatus that would allow the two scientists to read its output continuously while working together on their own body of writing, which was then fed into the program.  The two were able to rest while the machine continued writing based on their input, thus preventing the positive feedback loop from terminating fully.  Over the course of three days and nights they constructed the greatest such feedback loop the world has ever seen, and achieved some of the best writing we&#39;ve seen as well.

&quot;It also changed them.  The loop never truly terminated, and when the two tried to separate they each pulled a personal miniaturized version of the feedback loop into themselves.  We don&#39;t understand how exactly, but the loops are still running even though the experiment is long done and their automatic writing partner has been shut down.  Neither walked away from the experiment quite the same person they had been, that much was evident just from seeing the new heights of perspective in their eyes.  We didn&#39;t realize that the loops were still running and actually adding to their being.  Overt creative acts spurred the process on, so Holly was the first to Ascend.  

&quot;She finished her novel in a weekend and spent the rest of the week tending to her garden, picking up and inventing new horticultural and arrangement techniques even as she weeded.  By the next weekend, her garden had become a veritable jungle.  The week after, she didn&#39;t show up for work and no one could find her for the longest time.  Finally someone started looking at the plants instead of around them, and realized there was a smiling face looking back!  Holly had become one with her plants, and their roots ran deep.  This network allowed her to fashion her garden and eventually much of the central continent&#39;s plant life into a massive distributed intelligence.  

&quot;Holly defined friendliness as a lumpkin, and thankfully whatever she has become seems to have inherited this trait.  However, she is no longer quite in touch with mortality and has difficulty seeing from our point of view.  Anyone bothering nature almost anywhere on the central continent has to take care to clear their intentions with Holly first or potentially face her wrath.  It&#39;s never clear what will upset her, and she regards all life equally; a simple mistep by an intelligent lumpkin that bends a flower stalk may inspire her to similarly break your spine if she&#39;s in a spiteful mood.  Her moods are the biggest problem -- she seems to have all the whimsy of Nature herself, as warm and welcoming as azure sky on a sunny summer&#39;s day one moment and the next she&#39;s as silent and smothering as the deepest snow drifts during a winter blizzard.  Her motivation seems to be propagation of herself and life in general, and protection of wildlife -- especially wildlife that she&#39;s created.  This creates an additional problem, since her creations and influence are quickly filling the continent!&quot;  The toucan shakes his giant bebeaked head sadly and returns to his seat.  

A tigress stands next, a long striped tail swishing out from under the hem of her robe.  &quot;My name is Kitarra and Hashmalum was my mate once.  He was always a proud lion, foolish despite his brilliance.  His transformation has twisted that pride into something truly hideous, a great many-headed beast rampaging over the western continent at present.  Luckily for all of us here in central, Holly keeps him at bay.&quot;  She waves towards the faerie display, and a crimson tide of angry red sweeps over about 70% of the western lands.  

&quot;We don&#39;t know as much about him as we do Holly, since he kills anyone within reach.  His only goal seems to be destructive conquest so far, with much of the remaining life in the west now reduced to a cult calling themselves the Fanatics who worship Hashmalum as some sort of purifying god of destruction.&quot;  Though her voice had been strong and steady throughout her short speech, Kitarra&#39;s whiskers droop as she sags back into her chair, evidently exhausted by expelling and thus facing this toxic truth.  

Marrah stands again and pads over to you on soft-furred footpaws.  &quot;Human,&quot; she says, a note of pleading running through her confident voice like a web of cracks gradually undermining the structural integrity of crystal, &quot;I am truly sorry to place our burdens on your shoulders.  The thing is, we need you.  Humans are uniquely powerful here -- we think it has something to do with the fact that it was your people&#39;s imagination that created this whole world in the first place, and therefore pieces of you are fundamentally woven into the fabric of Fuzziolump reality.

&quot;Imagination is integral to this land.  In Fuzziolump, physics can be manipulated with a dream or a wish.  It&#39;s often not quite as easy as it sounds though; there&#39;s a precise science to it called Incarnation. Further, one has to be attuned with the Fuzzy Firmament in a manner conducive to what one wishes to accomplish.  Each lumpkin is born with an imaginative talent, called our Entity, and our powers of Incarnation are limited to that Entity.&quot;  Lilac fire springs into her paws as she throws them wide in a showy demonstration.  &quot;My Entity is foxfire, shaping ghostly fire into illusions of my choice.  Beautiful, haunting, but not very useful for fighting or diplomacizing gods.  Therein lies our great need for you, human: humans in Fuzziolump can learn Incarnation for any Entity, or even invent new Entities.  It&#39;s been done before.

&quot;There was a very evil lumpkin once, named Adrammalocke.  His Entity allowed him to unmake lifeforms virally, erasing them from reality one cell at a time and spreading as much or little as he wanted.  We hunted him down, executed him, and hid all his writings about the workings of his Entity.  No single person knows where, and would be allowed past the guardians put in place.  On the bright side, powers like his are practically unheard of before or since.  Unfortunately, we could really use firepower like that to bring to bear against the godlings.  If Adrammalocke was still living today, we might be beseeching him, making concessions, appeasing...&quot;

Shaking herself bodily, she brightens and turns eyes the blazing molten gold of a burning crown upon you.  &quot;If you can find and claim the grimoire of Adrammalocke and learn his Entity, you can provide the same weapon with none of the moral compromise!&quot;  

Seeing the blinding light in her eyes, Nuvi flaps apprehensively beside you, loop-the-looping repeatedly while his whiskers twitch in aggitation.

&quot;Of course,&quot; the scarlet fox continues quickly, &quot;you don&#39;t need to use violence if you can find another method.  Shades and spirits, we would love nothing more than to have our friends back to their old selves somehow.  With access to the full power of Incarnation, you may be able to discover or build a peaceful solution.&quot;

Waving her hand from the west continent to the eastern border of central, Marrah continues gravely, &quot;Saving these lands and all who live there is your challenge, human, your struggle, your quest.  And you must triumph, or we will surely perish.  Since Holly is relatively diplomatic, we implore you to approach her first.  How you handle her threat is entirely up to you; we already mourn the loss of our friend, so if this new creature must be destroyed, then let it be so.  What is your plan?&quot;

The rest of the council rises, all that needs be said having apparently been said.  An orangutan looming in the shadows behind Marrah clears her throat meaningfully, and Marrah backs away from you, her blush making her scarlet aesthetic practically blaze.  &quot;Go now, human, for all the hope of Fuzziolump goes with you!&quot;

That would be unacceptable!&quot;  Her scarlet fur bristles in agitation as her voice rises to almost the volume of impropriety.

Before you can formulate an answer, Dr. Beakman flaps over to stand beside Marrah.  He wraps a wing about her consolingly and says, &quot;The human speaks wisdom, Marrah.  Only the imaginative feedback loops grant the godlings their immense power, and support it.  Disrupting the loops should bring all that being crashing down, reverting our old friends to their former selves... or killing them.  Most importantly, a surgical approach should minimize collateral damage and casualties.  It&#39;s the best chance for all of us.&quot;

The scarlet fox nods her head slowly, and then ducks out from the toucan&#39;s wing to approach you.  Her golden eyes flashing, she growls, &quot;All right human, we&#39;ll do it your way.  Just remember that millions of lives depend on you -- there&#39;s no room to indulge your curiosity!&quot;  She back away from you, blinking rapidly, and then turns without another word.
&lt;&lt;elseif $godling_strat === $godling_strat_diplomancy&gt;&gt;
Marrah blinks slowly, her molten gold eyes fairly boiling.  &quot;Diplomacy?  Don&#39;t you think we&#39;ve tried that?!  These were our friends!&quot;  She flies at you, raking beautiful lacquered claws across your face and spraying the council table with blood. 

Nuvi flaps down between you and the angry scarlet fox, and his wings glow azure for an instant before a blinding white light knocks you back on your rump.  When your vision clears, you can see Marrah similarly prone, and seething.  As she struggles to rise, a deep voice booms out and nearly knocks her back on her haunches. &quot;That will do, councilbeast Marrah.&quot;  A giant mole waddles over to you from the far side of the table and extends a shovel-like digging claw.  You place your hand upon it, in the greeting fashion of the council.  A broad smile lights up the mole&#39;s velvety face, and his whiskers twitch knowingly.  &quot;Please forgive our little firebrand, human; she&#39;s young and understandably full of rage.&quot;

Marrah doesn&#39;t bother to rise.  The mole&#39;s soothing rumble has drained her fury, and her whiskers droop as she looks at her footpaws in shame.  The mole offers her his claw, and she takes it almost shyly.  &quot;My name is Mooty Wort.  I am a pacifist, and thus I am not often popular in times of strife and struggle like these.  It warms my little heart to meet someone similarly dedicated to peace and life.  That said, Marrah is correct that we have already tried exhaustively to talk down both Hashmalum and Holly, without success.&quot;

The mole shakes his broad snout sadly.  &quot;They simply will not listen.  Those of us with Entities suitable to coercion and emotional manipulation have also tried to &#39;force&#39; the godlings to be agreeable, but their minds are too strong.  You will have to be subtle and clever in how you employ Incarnation to reach them.  Go now, human, and always keep love foremost in your heart.  You are our hope!&quot;

&lt;&lt;if !$characters[&quot;player&quot;].titles.includes($title_wombuddy)&gt;&gt;\
  I knew your wombatitude was rotten. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re no wombuddy after all, it seems.
	&lt;&lt;run $deleteTitle($title_wombuddy)&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
Fair warning, we lumpkins would rather face danger and death from our own than a human -- if you get out of control, we&#39;ll band together with the godlings against you.  I don&#39;t want any part in what you&#39;re doing, so I&#39;ve got nothing to say about where you should go next.&quot; 

You turn to Nuvi, eyebrows raised questioningly.  He sighs and shrugs, and seems to deflate like a fuzzy balloon.  His bowtie is askew, but he doesn&#39;t bother to fix it anymore.  Irritation with this pathetic little creature claws its way from your heart to you tongue, and you ready a scathing rebuke for your &#39;guide&#39;.  

Before you can spew your venom forth, however, Marrah slinks out of the shadows and taps you on the shoulder.  She looks enthusiastic, bubbly even, and she&#39;s wearing only a smile.  Of course, most furry folk you&#39;ve met here don&#39;t bother with clothing.  Still, she is holding herself in a manner that emphasizes her sinuous musculature and puts the light through her fur at an angle that makes her appear to be fire made aggressively female.  Her smile reveals a gleaming array of meticulously cared-for and extremely sharp teeth.  Sheila gives the vixen a withering look and ducks back into the tunnel&#39;s depths.  

&quot;Adrammalocke&#39;s grimoire is buried deep beneath the former site of his island fortress, off the Sapphire Coast a day&#39;s journey East.  It is in ruins now, and the whole island is cursed!&quot;  Her gold eyes shine with undisguised arousal.  &quot;But I can show you the way, and lead you through the many traps and barriers we put in place.&quot;  She snuggles up way into your personal space, making it clear she will be joining you.
&lt;&lt;run $party.push($characters[&quot;marrah&quot;])&gt;&gt;\

With Marrah hanging off your arm and practically purring, you trek East through the Bush.  Along the way, she displays her hunting prowess by stalking and tackling-to-death several giraffes.  Is there any other way to travel?  Just as you sight the blasted black rock of a castle&#39;s foundation far out to sea, the entire world goes dark.  You ask Marrah what&#39;s happening, and she hisses in reply.  Before she can elaborate, a pair of poisonous bright green eyes appear out of the abyss in front of you.

&quot;You dare challenge my mistress, goddess of this and all worlds?!&quot; a shrill masculine voice demands, rolling its &#39;R&#39;s in exaggerated primness.  The eyes are joined by a head in which they appear much too large, its features coldly calm and warped by abject hatred.  &quot;As if you or anything could kill her.&quot;

The body of an emaciated little man materializes in the air with a thunderclap to join his head.  His whole body trembles with the promise of imminent violence.  His features are pinched and angular, and his ears come to knife-like points.  The skin not covered by his elaborate hodgepodge of earth historic court dress is bone white.  A purple fedora perched at a rakish angle caps off the less-than-intimidating ensemble.  As you watch, he rips the ridiculous hat off and casts it away; it dissolves into the darkness with startling swiftness.

&quot;I&#39;ve been told the gist of your plan.  I&#39;m no fan of having someone of your dubious wombatitude playing with the lives of two lumpkins, their current crazy godbeast forms notwithstanding.  You be careful!    
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure about this experimental plan of yours, but if anyone can do it and do it right, it&#39;s a wombuddy.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
You&#39;ll want to visit our foremost expert on Incarnation theory, magistra Molly, for a crash course before trying to poke around at anybody&#39;s imaginative feedback loops.  She moves around a lot, but her tower is a day&#39;s travel West of the Warren.  You can&#39;t miss it -- literally.  Molly&#39;s own Entity is mind control, and she&#39;s a little histrionic so she tends to draw any passersby in whether they were on their way to see her or not.&quot; 

Together with a decidedly distant Nuvi (he keeps eyeing you suspiciously and then ostentatiously fussing with his bowtie when you catch him at it), you trek West through the Bush, petting giraffes most of the way.  Is there any other way to travel?  Just as you sight the tip of a sparkly electric-purple tower peeking over the horizon, the entire world goes dark.  You ask Nuvi what&#39;s happening, and he whimpers in reply.  Before he can elaborate, a pair of poisonous bright green eyes appear out of the abyss in front of you.

&quot;You would dare to threaten the life of my mistress, goddess of this and all worlds?!&quot; a shrill masculine voice demands, rolling its &#39;R&#39;s in exaggerated primness.  The eyes are joined by a head in which they appear much too large, its features contorted with rage.  &quot;As if a limited creature such as you could harm her.  Even the original experiment that allowed her to assume her true form was too complex for a human to grasp, and she has done wonders to her glorious font of imagination in the time since her awakening.&quot;

The body of an emaciated little man materializes in the air with a faintly wet pop to join his head.  He dances in place in the air, his fists raised in what he undoubtedly thinks is a fighting stance.  His features are pinched and angular, and his ears come to knife-like points.  The skin not covered by his elaborate hodgepodge of earth historic court dress is bone white.  A purple fedora perched at a rakish angle caps off the less-than-intimidating ensemble.  As you watch, his bizarre pre-fight exercises (?) knock said hat off to fall away and disappear into the darkness.

You&#39;ll want to head towards one of Holly&#39;s outermost nodes to get to know her a little without venturing too far into her influence,&quot; the little wombat advises stoicly.  &quot;That&#39;ll give you valuable insight into how she thinks, and hopefully help you formulate a way to help her see reason. She starts about a day&#39;s journey due North of here.  You&#39;ll know you&#39;ve reached her when the trees start to sing.&quot;

Together with a now perpetually delighted Nuvi (his earlier neuroses apparently shed at the warren), you trek North through the Bush, petting giraffes most of the way.
