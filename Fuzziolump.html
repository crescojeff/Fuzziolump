The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&#39;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&#39;s intrusive. Also gross.

The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.

His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.

It could go with the whole crap from Earth lost in dryers theme, though it wouldn&#39;t explain immediately how Fuzziolump came to be in the first place.  Anyway, I was thinking nanites that are sensitive to specific electromagnetic fields generated by thought patterns of organisms, and take predictable actions based on the field modulations.  This would effectively allow for psychic/emotional magic by proxy, and could even explain how the creatures of FUzziolump came to be as they are (genetic manipulation to create sapience and foment nanite propogation and maximum evolution efficiency).

--I&#39;m actually preferring something more fantasy-esque, such as subatomic organisms that react to thought/emotion EMFs in predictable ways.  That or maybe some particle or link between particles in Fuzziolump that reacts to psychic EMFs without any particular organism with motivations involved, such that the situation is effectively more direct rather than by proxy (really don&#39;t wanna proc memories of fucking midiclorians).  

--Creatures encountered should be silly intelligent animals but also perhaps some more exotic things that could be symbolic of creativity and emotion, such as Madoka style abstract art lifeforms.  May also consider some dangerous and unfuzzy creatures to reflect the dark side of creativity and emotion.

--the human&#39;s mana stat should be emotion levels, which will be modified by various actions.  Some will increase with related magic usage, but there will be negative consequences if they get too high (e.g. anger)!


-Setting: SciFey meets Redwall Abbey.  Basically a world similar to the Pathfinder primordial Fey world, but with slightly less magic and more pseudo-science behind its inception via imagination/emotion.  Also, Redwall level cute creatures all over the place.  Specifically, I was thinking something along the lines of somehow &lt;insert pseudoscience here&gt; the world of Fuzziolump came into being as a parallel universe derived from the thoughts and feelings of earth lifeforms.  This process was glacial at first, but sped up greatly as sapience emerged.  Once sapient thought was being communicated by proxy via radio waves in various and sundry forms, the development process increased exponentially.  Basically Fuzziolump was fairly unevolved until humanity came around, and then was fairly primitive and amorphous until humans invented radio communications; the direct point to point electronic comm of telegraphy helped, but was less effective than blasting out thoughts to the ether for reception at some planned point, but then also anywhere else that happened to be receiving.
-Story: a group of Fuzziolumpkins have gone rogue and are trying to use human tech to destroy others?  Doesn&#39;t really jive with the nanite thing, or any magic system really.  I was thinking this when the world was supposed to be just animals with incidental human tech who eventually grew smarts because smarts were needed to survive in a world of randomly appearing and potentially deadly high technology.  I&#39;m thinking I want to go more Sanderson fantasy though; less pressure to explain everything in terms of real-ish science.

Okay, much more interesting story idea based on new SciFey setting -- the Fuzziolumpkins have been developing much more quickly since the onset of radio based tech in the 20th century, and now with broadband internet they&#39;re beginning to see a rather worrying trend: creatures something like gods are being born.  This apotheosis is frightening and occasionally disastrous, so they brought in a human creative to help them understand how to control and potentially dismantle some of the organisms resultant from human and now Fuzziolumpkin (which was inspired by human but now, relatively recently thanks to radio, exists independently) imagination.  At least one of these will be some sort of big bad that fights back, and others will be sympathetic spirits that are still problematic.

-Combat:
Two easy options for combat in a text adventure
1. Choose your own adventure style, where each combat situation is really just another choice and only the details of the choice and associated consequences make it combat.
Pros:
-relatively easy to implement
Cons:
-combat doesn&#39;t feel much different from anything else
-in order for combat to be interesting, the author needs to ensure that the consequences of the offered choices could reasonably be deduced by the player ahead of time such that you don&#39;t run into those frustrating &#39;swing sword -&gt; obviously that means you catch your arm on a rock and the dragon eats you&#39; situations that leave the player feeling powerless and the game mechanics arbitrary.

2. RPG style turn-based combat with uniform set of actions and usual conditions for victory e.g. enemy or player runs out of HP.  In this case the choice set would be uniform and act as the combat interface.
Pros:
-player is more in control

-Objects:

--Sprig of Holly: focus for imagination due to its strong association with being a divine focus in lore.  Also, it has actually become a divine focus for the blossoming dryad goddess Holly for the same reason!  And yes, the name collision is confusing. 

-Characters:
--Nuvi the flying otter guide: player&#39;s guide through their adventure.  Swims through the air via gravity assist of some sort; wings are slightly for precision maneuvers and mostly for show.  He is very dapper and proper, and he worries about the human&#39;s safety.  His opinion re: the godlings is that they&#39;re rampant growth has to be checked for the good of all, but that new lifeforms should be allowed to thrive.
--Shimmerin the faerie princess: she is a trickster among tricksters and wishes to revive the faerie courts so that faeries can act freely in Fuzziolump as they once did.  To do this, she will need the power of the First Summer Queen&#39;s tiara.  The treasure hoard of the faeries is cursed to only allow those with hearts as pure as a mole&#39;s to touch it, and hers is darkened by bitterness.  She tempts the human to follow her in hopes that they can either touch the treasure themselves or manipulate an ice mole into doing it for them.  Since she wants to see the current Fuzziolump regime fall, she is secretly in favor of the godling revolution and will subtley hinder the human on their quest to stop it.  Despite her somewhat dark agenda, she is friendly by default and enjoys joking with comrades.  The human fascinates her, and she is constantly tryint to learn more about humanity.  She is good at heart and can be redeemed once her secret is out, so long as the human is amenable to revisiting the status of faeries in Fuzziolump with the council.  Else, she will fight the human when the truth comes out. She has a limited ability to grant wishes, in exchange for dreams; if the player allows her to eat some number of their dreams, Shimmerin can work wonders like curative magic which is otherwise very rare.  She presents this exchange as giving her creative inspiration, which it does, which she can use to power the godlings, but it also gives her footholds into the player&#39;s psyche.  The more she has, the more difficult she will be to resist when the truth comes out.
--Woolliam the tenacious wombat: gentle, kind, and determined, Woolliam insists on accompanying the human to help in quelling the growing godling threat, despite the wombat elder&#39;s refusal.  He wants to protect those in his humble sphere of influence and believes he cannot do so without venturing outside the warren.  He will follow the player as stealthily as a wombat can (not very) and provide random assistance.  Despite his brave attempts to help, he is actually pathologically shy and has great difficulty dealing with anyone.  Shimmerin delights in tormenting him. 
--Puck the spirit of ivy: clingy spirit obsessed with Holly; she does not comprehend his feelings, and is amused by his attentions.  She encourages/teases him without understanding the cruelty of these actions.  He wants to see her continue to ascend no matter what the cost, and will fight to the death if he feels she is being threatened.
--Holly the wild goddess (godling): godling of nature and wild things who has gained much perspective from being in many places at once, and has also lost a fair bit from the vantage of lesser beings (e.g. empathy with Puck).  She adores all living things and wants to be sweet and gentle with them; her unpredictable temper makes this difficult, however, and her connection to so many imaginations is making her grow faster than any godling.  Even if she realized the danger she poses to those living things around her by her growth she likely could not stop herself without help. 

-Storyboard:
1. human goes through the dryer to the snowy glade and meets Mr. Tumn-- er Nuvi or whoever, the flying otter guide.  Otter explains somewhat about Fuzziolump and what the human should be doing there. EXPOSITION!

2. nuvi explains the problem they&#39;re having with pesky gods being born, and says that a consensus was reached by the animal council (insert animal themed council pun here) that a human creative should be brought in to help figure out how to slow and undo some of the creativity flying around.

2.1 a faerie is encountered in the bejeweled pines room of the frosted forest, and the player can optionally chase after her to get her in the party as a side quest.

3. first step on that journey is heading to the council so they can give more information on particularly troubling developments and decide which the human should address first.  The council resides in the Wombat Warren which is located north of the Frosted Forest in which the Atrium Glade resides.  The human must travel North through the Frosted Forest until the trees thin and the snows disappear, and the ecosystem suddenly changes to a warm savannah called the Bush.  There they will start to see holes everyplace, and Nuvi will inform the human that these all lead to the Wombat Warren.  

/*
However, some also travel to private dens, so the human must find public tunnels; this requires a wombat&#39;s sense.  Lacking same, the human must try and fail until patterns indicating private tunnels are noted in the individual tunnel descriptions.  The tunnel descriptions should show up randomly, and each failure tosses the human back to the edge of the Bush; this way they actually need to either get lucky or recognize the signs and pass over private burrows until they come randomly to one that does not fit the private bill, which will be a public tunnel.
*/
What Wombats Want: However, most tunnels also pass by or even through private dens so the human must figure out what each wombat family they encounter wants in exchange for passage.  This will be hinted at in the descriptions of the dens, and some wombats may &quot;help&quot; with riddles. 

4. once inside the Wombat Warren, the human meets the animal council.  They inform human that Holly is the first god to approach, since she is growing like many, many weeds and is relatively amiable.  The main question is how the human should go about regressing or at least controlling the creativity that is driving her growth; the human has several choices for how to approach this [choice]{
a. violence (find vital module if possible, cut it out) [effect: nuvi aff -5, council aff +1]
b. hug it out (try to convince her that her wild growth is becoming deleterious to her fellow &#39;lumpkins) [effect: nvi aff +3, council aff: -1]
c. prune (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to limit her supply to the tune of reducing her expanse to a steady state -- halting her growth rather than reversing it) [effect: Nuvi aff +5, council aff: +3]
d. dig up the root (find out what imagination and emotion specifically fuels Holly, and find a way to starve her of same until she wilts) [effect: Nuvi aff -10,  council aff: -5]

5. Having decided on a strategy, the human exits the Wombat Warren and heads towards the Blissful Blossoms forest to the West, where Holly makes her home.  On the way, the human is challenged by Puck, a pesky small god of the wind who listens to secrets and overheard the planning session with the council; he is in love with Holly, and will not hear of any suppression of her growth.  He fights the human!

You see, Fuzziolump has long been a place of peace for the most part, but recently there has been an upwelling of violence and turmoil.  The cause is our gods.  

We didn&#39;t have any at first.  The fully mortal lumpkins are quite complex enough, and even with the vast sum of Earth&#39;s imaginings it took ages for us to develop.  Several centuries have passed since we grew smart enough to start recording our history, and it seems the more we wrote and thought and felt the experiences of life, the faster Fuzziolump grew.  Its own denizens&#39; imaginings fuel it in addition to Earth&#39;s pool of creative energy, and this exponentiation has led to more potent lifeforms.  Effectively, gods.

Now, this might be cause for celebration -- a whole new category of sapient life, more deeply sapient than any of us can fathom!  Unfortunately, power and depth of mind do not equate to wisdom.  The young gods of Fuzziolump are all very different, but their common trait is an understandable lack of experience combined with an unprecedented ability to influence the world around them.  Some have even learned to syphon off the creative energy Fuzziolump thrives on, and threaten to collapse this world in on itself.  It isn&#39;t clear what would happen the gods if this world perished, but I and my loved ones and millions more like us would surely be snuffed out like the humble little candle flames we are.  I cannot allow that to happen.

What to do though?  Every lumpkin knows that Earth and humanity are our progenitors, specifically your creativity.

Nuvi flaps off northward a short span, then pauses as he notes you are not beside him.  Looking back and flashing a reassuring and whiskery grin, he proffers a fuzzy little paw to you.  Squaring your shoulders with purpose, you gently take the soft paw and allow the otter to lead you through the hidden paths in the thick snow-blanketed verge.  

After some stumbling and a small labyrinth of green and whit, he leads you to
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
You stand amongst
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
a dazzling array of colors: the trees here are no less dusted with snow than their fellows you just pushed through, but they have also been festooned with crystal and glass baubles of every conceivable hue.  [[Little soft-glowing lights-&gt;Faery_Desc]] flit from ornament to ornament, keeping the emphasis and shading dynamic.

&quot;A small tree effigy fell into this forest long ago, decorated in a similar manner. The trees here were so smitten by the style they demanded to be honored with comparable shinies and lights.  The [[dryads-&gt;Dryad_Desc]] felt abashed that trees elsewhere were so honored, and strove to worship their charges fittingly.  Unluckily for the glass-blowers and enterprising faeries, the trend did not catch on elsewhere in the forest.&quot;

Nuvi flaps down close your ear, his whiskers tickling, and he whispers,  &quot;The other trees consider these ones a bit gaudy.&quot;  He holds a little paw over his mouth to stifle his giggles.  When his hearty laughter knocks his monocle off, he sobers quickly.  Alighting by your foot to retrieve it, he clears his throat and asks, &quot;Shall we [[continue North to the plains?-&gt;Bush]]&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Faery_Desc" tags="creature lumpkin description" position="170,1045" size="100,100">Peering closely at the nearest bobbing lights, you note that at the center of each little sphere is a diminutive woman (you guess about 6cm in height) with six dragonfly wings. 

&quot;Those are faeries,&quot; Nuvi informs you, &quot;whimsical little beauties with insatiable curiosity.  They trade their light for secrets, whispered by the woods; little goes on anywhere nearby that isn&#39;t witnessed by the trees.&quot;

Each faery&#39;s wings are different colors, like intricate stained glass.  As you watch, a faery winks at you and performs a graceful series of barrel rolls while the colors of her wings shift and the soft lilac light pulsing off her skin twinkles to produce a mesmerizing chromatic metamorphosis.  She giggles at your awed expression, and [[zooms off out of sight-&gt;Faery_Friend]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Dryad_Desc" tags="description lumpkin creature" position="164,901" size="100,100">&quot;Dryads are the keepers of the woods.  They tend the trees, guide their growth, and defend them ferosciously.&quot;  Nuvi points a small claw toward a strange pattern along the bark of a nearby willow, and you realize a feminine face is looking back at you!  Wood creaks softly as she leans out from the tree to watch you passing.  Now that she has separated herself from the bark somewhat, you can see that a large assortment of the glitz you had taken for light cast by the tree&#39;s copious ornaments is actually jewelry.  A gleaming tiara adorns the mane of gossamer vines, leaves, and spider silk that form her waist-length hair.

&quot;They don&#39;t usually go in for all that finery, but the bejeweled dryads have as curious a sense of style as their trees.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Faery_Friend" tags="party_mod character shimmerin" position="565,1151" size="100,100">/*

Nuvi hovers patiently nearby as you dart off after the faery.  She&#39;s waiting for you on the far side of the tree, and as soon as she confirms you are following her she winks cheerily and disappears into the surrounding foliage.  She seems to want you to [[chase her-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Ghostly_Greeting_Chamber]], but Nuvi is waiting [[back amongst the bejeweled pines-&gt;Bejeweled_Pines]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Shimmerin_Chase_Ghostly_Greeting_Chamber" tags="shimmerin party_mod character quest room" position="593,1404" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;

Crashing through the frosted pines as gracefully as possible for a fully grown human following a faery no larger than your little finger, you chase after the elusive sphere of lilac light.  Luckily, she&#39;s waiting just at the edge of the current clearing every time you make it through an obstacle blocking line of sight to her.  However, she has veered off in many different directions and you&#39;ve lost track of where you are relative to the Bejeweled Pines and Nuvi.

You stand in the center of what was once a grand antechamber, for certain values of grand: everything, from the fallen grandiose pillars to the rime-encrusted iron skeletons of elaborate furniture is miniature scale relative to you.  It feels a bit like walking into a dollhouse store that a ruination of weather and time have trampled to ghostly memories. 

The faery giggles and flits off through a [[close copse of pines to the East-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Frozen_Stair]], leaving a sprinkle of powder in her wake. There is an [[old and sturdy rope-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Diamond_Throneroom]] hanging over a small cliff to the South.  Away West, a collapsed archway leads to a subtley sunken glade that may once have been a [[gallery of sorts-&gt;Shimmerin_Chase_Treasure_Of_Stillness]].

	You can hear a faint whisper on the wind, &quot;Human!  Huuuuuuuman!&quot;.  It sounds vaguely dapper and certainly whiskery, so you deduce it is likely Nuvi looking for you.  You could choose to [[follow the voice if you&#39;re done playing with the faery.-&gt;Bejeweled_Pines]]

//todox: our first game element!  Surprise, surprise, it&#39;s a maze.  I don&#39;t want it to be a bunch of twisty passages all alike though; the player doesn&#39;t have enough inventory junk for that yet.  Plus those kinda suck.  There should be clear landmarks in the maze, allowing the player to actually learn and traverse it without making their own landmarks out of dropped items, BUT these landmarks should ideally shift as time goes by such that they really only exist as patterns of landscape.  That way the player has to recognize the patterns as a simple puzzle in order to navigate the maze. Shimmerin may alter things and leave false clues as well. 

// The simplest way to do something like the above would probably be to have a prefab maze in mind, and then randomly/conditionally change little bits of the descripter text for each room, and each room could be implemented as a prefab passage in Twine.  So draw that maze first!

//todo: make the mole go CC when player is already in the room when it arrives.  Also make sure the mole&#39;s direction of burrowing is clear so that this doesn&#39;t turn into another Rilix Castle situation that can&#39;t be solved without already knowing the map.

Carefully hewn marble shows through the blanket of ice and snow, giving the area a feeling of patchy oppulence.

You stand in a small valley surrounded by sheer cliffs of slick sapphire ice and unforgiving slate-gray stone.  The remains of graduated curved stone benches step down in a hemisphere around a clearing below and infrastructure that reminds you of the retractable roofing in fancier outdoor theatres peeks out from snow drifts here and there.  Down at the center of the declining rows of benches is a large marble dais, upon which proudly stands the most enormously overwrought chair you&#39;ve ever seen -- truly a throne.  It is majestic and imperious, with impossibly intricate and delicate gossamer weaves of crystals and gems decorating its broad frame; the morning light shining through their many hues blankets the dais in a constant rainbow corona.  The dais abutts a massive waterfall, all its roaring might condensed into a single moment frozen forever in time.  And ice.  A chill wind kisses your cheek and you shiver, feeling profoundly alone.

Heaps of gold coins and gemstones lay scattered about in the snow and ice.  The coins show significant patina and undisturbed drifts blanket much of the hoard, suggesting that it has been here for some time.  As you ogle the goodies, you imagine you can hear it calling out to you, begging to be scooped up and appreciated.  Notably, several humanoid bones are interspersed with the treasures.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You stand in a large clearing where someone has apparently cultivated a vast garden of crystals.  Instead of the soft greens of pine and holly, eldritch purples, blues, reds, and every color imaginable (and a few that are like no color you&#39;ve imagined previously) filter the subtle sunlight into spectacular rainbows over you.  The dusting of snow only mutes the effect slightly, pleasantly keeping it mysterious rather than gaudy.  Faeries flit amongst the crystalline horticulture, adding their own colors to the filtered sunlight.  Brushing by an explosion of amethyst that looks a bit lke the leaves of a pineapple, you shy away as a sharp pain stings your arm and a warm rivulet of blood seeps into your clothing -- the verge here is beautiful and deadly. 

Several of the crystals are carved to look like fanciful animals (or, here, regular animals) reading books and wearing stylish clothes.  There are humans too, as well as a few winged humanoids that might be faeries; you note that they are the same size.  The time and care involved in cultivating and pruning crystal topiary boggles your mind. 
As a cool wind ruffles the distant foliage, the crystal garden produces a light tinkling that settles into a deeper resonant hum as the garden vibrates. 

&lt;&lt;if not $party.includes($character_shimmerin)&gt;&gt;
The fairy you&#39;re chasing peeks out from behind a sapphire flower as tall as you.  When she sees you approaching, she winks flirtatiously and blows you a little kiss.  

	&lt;&lt;if $characters[&quot;player&quot;].inventory.includes($summer_court_tiara)&gt;&gt;
		Then, her eyes shift to your pack, which has begun to hum and vibrate softly.  Zooming over in a blur of enthusiasm, the little fairy opens your pack, dives in, and emerges holding reverently the tiny tiara you picked up in the treasure room.
		
		&quot;This... how did you get this?&quot; she asks, breathlessly, her face a mask of astonishment and all pretense of teasing silliness forgotten.  &quot;She&#39;s the Summer Queen&#39;s own tiara, and has been lost to us since the fall of the courts centuries ago.  Everything hears her call, faeries most of all, so we knew she was under the ice amongst the forsaken treasures but no one could get past the treasure&#39;s curse to reach her!&quot;
		// todo: the question should be more how rather than where, since the treasure room is right over there.  I would say the focus should be on the treasure&#39;s curse repelling raiders, and the mole&#39;s pure goodness and innocence making it immune.  As for why the fairy never noticed that, well maybe the mole isn&#39;t frightened of them and/or maybe they don&#39;t have the attention to detail necessary to set up the mole to dig things out for them.
		
		// todo: do we want a conversation here?  It could be done without too too much hassle by setting control vars to manage the passage text here and adding an exit conversation link in the conversation branch passages that comes back here.  Does it serve a purpose, however?  On the one hand, we could force the player&#39;s tongue here and give their truthful answer about the mole which would allow Shimmerin to respond that she never noticed the mole digging frenziedly and/or was unable/unwilling to frighten it.  On the other hand, we could let the player lie or ignore Shimmerin, which would mod her affinity.  We could even give the player a CHA score, which can be influenced by equipment etc, which influences the likelihood of the bluff succeeding.  I guess the main question is: is there a response the player could give that would significantly (i.e. not just slight affinity mod) change something re: Shimmerin in the story going forward?  Eh, I suppose so: maybe Shimmerin decides that the player must be as good-hearted and earnest as a mole and the aff takes a big jump up AND we add &#39;mole-level-good&#39; to her inductive bias re: the player, which could well have important consequences later (e.g. she assumes something that can&#39;t hurt the pure of heart can&#39;t hurt the player, and so doesn&#39;t warn them...)

&quot;Ecosystems work pretty differently here,&quot; Nuvi explains, prompted by your stunned expression.  &quot;They depend more on our collective conception of what a place should be like rather than weather patterns and physics and all that fluff humans are always going on about.&quot;  Despite the heat, your thick-furred companion glides along as serenely as ever.  He hums [[a tune you&#39;re unfamiliar with-&gt;Bush_Tune]].

Innumerable holes dot the landscape like spots on a giraffe, which, incidentally, you can see several of in the distance.

To the West, the Savannah opens up into a vast sea of grasses and roaming wildlife.  A distant craggy mountain range looms in the East.  Several curious whiskered faces are poking up out of the nearest [[hole directly North-&gt;Bush_Wombat_Burrow_1]].

todo: the puzzle here is to find the item or perform the service of one of the wombat families to gain passage through their burrow to the warren proper.  The moon logic here is that wombats trust deeply but require that trust to be earned, so the tribute stuff should be more practical than flattering.  Now the tricky part here is that it doesn&#39;t make any damn sense for the wombats to be cryptic about what they need, but at the same time nobody likes a fetch quest.  Probably a fair compromise is to have the wombats simply present a problem they need help with and finding a solution in the world is up to the player.  However, that sounds like a job for after demo, when the world is more expansive.  Maybe for now simply have each present a situation that requires the player to spend resources?

Wombat Family 1: needs help treating their sick elders.  (can be helped either by med. herb from Frosty Forest, or from Shimmerin healing wish)

Wombat Family 2: needs help rescuing a trapped digger from a collapsed tunnel. (can be helped by player physically at the cost of health, or small amount of mana can be expended for a risky teleportation rescue that can fail).

Wombat Family 3: needs to cross a chasm to explore new tunneling territory. (faerie statue can be used for limited flight, or player can spend mana to do same)

Alternatively/additionally, I&#39;d like some kind of wombat digging dungeon angle, maybe a maze or similar challenge to make the human prove they have a wombat&#39;s good sense and sensibilities by way of being at home underground.  A simple and expediant possibility might be for Sheila to simply give the player a series of what-ifs to answer, centered around wombatian ethics and concerns.  The player&#39;s answers will contribute to Sheila&#39;s inductive bias re: player, and will also have a point value that needs to reach some threshold for the human to be named Wombuddy.  The tricky part with this option is failure: if the human doesn&#39;t meet the threshold, what happens?  New what-if scenarios and associated chances to answer are the most obvious recourse other than simple GAME OVER, which is stupid, but that would require generative narrative.  Maybe we could get away with a single set of scenarios, but have Sheila remember and comment if the player needs to basically exhaust all their options.  Since the player&#39;s choices will be canned responses from them, it wouldn&#39;t look to Sheila like the player had simply tried every choice combo, but at the same time she would know that the player had to make multiple attempts at coming up with satisfactory answers.  This could go into the persistent inductive bias of both Sheila and Nuvi, and effect events later in the game.

&quot;A human!&quot; a small voice squeaks, and the whiskered faces disappear down the hole.  You approach slowly, Nuvi in the lead -- being a more familiar sight to them, he can serve as a sort of literally soft transition for the little wombats. 

&quot;Hello gentle wombats!&quot;  Nuvi calls out ahead.  &quot;I&#39;m an agent of the council, escorting a human consultant to help with our little problem.  We&#39;ll need to pass through into the Warren, please and thank you.&quot;

A broad snout covered in a wiry blanket of tawny fur rises above the lip of the hole, a steady brow arched skeptically over glistening black eyes.  &quot;Human?  To see the council?  The situation must be getting desperate, indeed.&quot;  The wombat levels a stern but fair gaze at you. &quot;Their presence here will accelerate the godlings&#39; growth -- the council realizes that don&#39;t they?&quot;

Nuvi performs a placating barrel roll and responds, &quot;Peace, noble wombat sister.  The council is well aware of the many consequences associated with bringing a human to Fuzziolump, chief among them the imaginative accelerant effect.  It was decided that the risk of accelerating the godlings&#39; expansion was worth taking if it might mean stopping them altogether.  This human is a creative, an expert on generating and, presumably, suppressing creativity.&quot;

The wombat taps her tough leathery nose several times with a mighty digging claw as she considers the otter&#39;s words.  &quot;So they&#39;ve run out of ideas that aren&#39;t dangerous and foolhardy, then?  Fine enough.  However, the warren is a place of wombats and wombuddies, and the only way in leads through our home burrows.  This human will need to prove themselves a wombuddy just like anyone else before they can pass through.&quot;

		Sheila the wombat&#39;s broad snout appears from nothing quicker than a flash of lightning over the edge of the tunnel as you approach.  Her expression of stoic vigilance breaks into a smile as warm as being enveloped in wombat fur as she recognizes you.
